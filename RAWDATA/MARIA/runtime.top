u: (abstractmethoderror) Thrown when an application tries to call an <span class="k">abstract</span> method.
Normally, this error is caught by the compiler. It could occur at run time only if the callee were modified
to make the method or enclosing class <span class="k">abstract</span> without recompiling both caller and
callee.

u: ( jre not installed) If the <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/jre.html">JRE</a> is not installed, install it. Normally, you only need
the latest version,<!-- macro JRE fullversion --><!-- generated --><span class="version">1.8.0_131</span><!-- /generated by JRE -->, none of the older ones. This is a common Java Web Start problem. The
<!-- macro Acronym JRE --><!-- generated --><span class="acronym"><abbr title="Java Runtime Environment">JRE</abbr></span><!-- /generated by Acronym -->
is indeed installed and works fine for non Java Web Start apps. Java Web Start apps sometimes work fine
launched from a browser, but fail when launched from a desktop shortcut. My theory is somehow the
registry or the Java Web Start development cache gets corrupted in a way that causes Java to use a
version of <span class="exe">javaws.exe</span> with the wrong matching directory. There will be at least
three copies on your machine <span class="exe"><!-- macro JRE path --><!-- generated --><span class="path"><span class="drive">C:</span>\<span class="dir">Program Files</span>\<span class="dir">java</span>\<span class="dir">jre1.8.0_131</span>\</span><!-- /generated by JRE -->\bin\javaws.exe</span>, <span class="exe"><!-- macro JDK path --><!-- generated --><span class="path"><span class="drive">J:</span>\<span class="dir">Program Files</span>\<span class="dir">java</span>\<span class="dir">jdk1.8.0_131</span>\</span><!-- /generated by JDK -->

<br/>
<em>Detail from The Scream, by Edvard Munch</em>
<p><span class="package">java.lang</span>.<span class="class">NoClassDefFoundError:</span> <span class="package">mypackage</span>/ <span class="class">MyClass</span>
<br/>
This one is a bitch to track down. It has so many causes. Java is so picky! A misplaced comma, quote,
semicolon, extraneous extension or even the wrong upper/lower case can derail the whole program. I hope
some will implement the <a class="project" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/project/noclassdeffounderror.html">NoClassDefFoundError Amanuensis</a> to make the problem easier to
track down.</p>
<p>Sun explains that it is thrown when Java Virtual Machine or a ClassLoader instance tries to load in
the definition of a class \(as part of a normal method call or as part of creating a new instance using
the new expression \) and no definition of the class could be found. The searched-for class definition
existed when the currently executing class was compiled, but the definition can no longer be found. It is
similar to a <span class="class">ClassNotFoundException</span>. This gives you the hint that a <span class="class">NoClassDefFoundError</span> problem was <strong>not</strong> with caused by a 
<!-- macro Qualified Class.forName class --><!-- generated --><span class="qualified"><span class="class">Class</span>.<span class="method">forName</span></span><!-- /generated by Qualified -->.</p>
<ol><li>Essentially the problem is the place and name where you put the class file, free-standing on disk
or inside a jar, does match the place and name it should have, based on the classpath, the package name
and the class name. Everything is case-sensitive and sensitive to the tiniest typo. Unfortunately,
there is currently no <a class="project" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/project/noclassdeffounderror.html">tool</a> to tell
you where the class should be placed \(usually there are several possibilities \) or where it is now.</li>
<li>You got the class name wrong on the <span class="exe">java.exe</span> command line. It must include
the full package name and class separated by dots, without the <span class="ext">*.class</span> e.g.
<div class="bat">java.exe com.mindprod.converter.Convert</div><strong>not</strong> just the class:
<div class="bat">java.exe Convert</div>Newbies often get in trouble by adding a <span class="ext">*.java</span> or <span class="ext">*.class</span> suffix. In contrast, <span class="exe">javac.exe</span> demands the <span class="ext">*.java</span> extension.</li>
<li>You get an error message like this: <span class="output">Exception in thread <span class="quoted">main</span> java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: XXX/java</span>. When attempting to compile, you
keyed <span class="bat">java.exe XXX.java</span> instead of <span class="bat">javac.exe
XXX.java</span>.</li>
<li>Java can't find the class mentioned. It is missing from the jar or classpath. Java may need
it because it occurs as a class or superclass in a serialised <span class="class">ObjectStream</span>
or because you called a method of that class. You don't find out about the problem at compile
time or even load time. You only find out when you actually go to use that missing class. The missing
class was present when the class referencing it was compiled \(perhaps on somebody else's machine \)
but the missing class is no longer accessible. To fix a vanilla <span class="class">NoClassDefFoundError</span>, search the all the jar files on your machine for the missing
class. <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/searchreplace.html">Funduc Search and Replace</a> will do that. If you
can't find it, scour the web for a download. When you find it, make sure its jar is on the
general classpath, the project classpath, the command line classpath or in the <span class="dir">ext</span> directories of the various <!-- macro Acronym JREs --><!-- generated --><a class="acronymdef" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/jre.html">JREs</a> \(<span class="means"><span class="ac">J</span>ava <span class="ac">R</span>untime <span class="ac">E</span>nvironments</span> \)<!-- /generated by Acronym -->
you have installed. There will be at least two <span class="dir">ext</span> directories.
<div class="see"><a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/classpath.html">classpath</a></div></li>
<li>Three diagnostic tools you may find helpful:
<ol><li>To dump the classpath that you are actually using at some point in your code insert: You must
first determine if the classpath is correct with:
<!-- macro JDisplay classpath.getclasspath.javafrag --><!-- generated --><iframe class="jdisplay" height="461" src="snippet/iframe/classpath.getclasspath.javafrag.htm" style="overflow:scroll" width="800"></iframe><!-- /generated by JDisplay --></li>
<li>If you have a jar or more than one class, assign each class to a package! Package-less classes
are for one-shot, single-class throw-away experiments only.</li>
<li>Then when you are sure the jar or directory you want is truly on the classpath \(it is not
sufficient for the directory that the jar is in be on the classpath \), then check the contents of
the jar with <span class="exe">jarlook</span> to make sure your package/class is in there, spelled
precisely, including case. You can <a class="download" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/products1.html#JARLOOK">download
jarlook</a> with source.</li>
<li><a class="download" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/products1.html#JARCHECK">download jarcheck</a> as well. It will
help you detect problems with unexpected target versions of class files in your jars.</li></ol></li>
<li>Recall that reconstitution of serialized files uses <span class="class">Class</span>. <span class="method">forName</span> to instantiate all the classes buried in the files. <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/genjar.html">Genjar</a> or equivalent does not know to include these classes in your jar. It is up to
you to include all the classes you need manually. You will keep getting the dreaded <span class="class">NoClassDefFoundError</span> until you have nailed them all.</li>
<li>Look for a typo in spelling the class file name in the file or in the command line invoking its
main method. Copy/paste to make sure they are absolutely identical including case.</li>
<li>Check your <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/classpath.html">classpath</a>. Make sure you used semicolons or
colons as appropriate. Don't specify null fields in your classpath, e.g. two semicolons in a
row.</li>
<li>The problem is essentially either the class is not on the classpath or the classpath is wrong. You
must first determine if the classpath is correct with:
<!-- macro JDisplay classpath.getclasspath.javafrag --><!-- generated --><iframe class="jdisplay" height="461" src="snippet/iframe/classpath.getclasspath.javafrag.htm" style="overflow:scroll" width="800"></iframe><!-- /generated by JDisplay --></li>
<li>If your program used to work and it <span class="quoted">suddenly</span> stopped working, did you
upgrade your JDK/JRE? If so, you likely forgot to copy over the jars to the <span class="dir">
<!-- macro JRE path --><!-- generated --><span class="path"><span class="drive">C:</span>\<span class="dir">Program Files</span>\<span class="dir">java</span>\<span class="dir">jre1.8.0_131</span>\</span><!-- /generated by JRE -->\lib\ext</span> and <span class="dir">

<li>You wrote some code like this:
<!-- macro JDisplay errormessages.exceptionininitializererror.javafrag --><!-- generated --><pre class="java"><span class="commentslashslash">// one way to trigger an ExceptionInInitializerError</span>

<span class="class">Exception</span> during the <span class="k">static</span> initialisation, it will
show up as a <span class="class">ExceptionInInitializerError</span> rather than the original
<span class="class">Exception</span>, which your code may not be prepared to handle. When your code
later goes to use the class, you will get a <span class="class">NoClassDefFoundException</span>.</li>
<li>If you see the phrase <span class="quoted">wrong name</span> in the error message, it means you are
not consistently naming the <span class="package">packagename</span>. <span class="class">ClassName</span> everywhere. Perhaps you left off the packagename, or got the case wrong, or
made a typo in either the package or class name.</li>
<li>If you have two packages that use classes from each other, each jar must have all the classes of
the other package that it uses, or that it uses indirectly uses.
<div class="see"><a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/dependencies.html">dependencies</a></div></li>
<li>You must put the <span class="parm">-classpath</span> option before the class name on the java
command line. To remember the order, you can think of it like this. <span class="exe">Java.exe</span>
needs to know the classpath before it can search for the class.</li>
<li>You got package name wrong at the top of the source file, or left it out entirely. It does not
match the one when you built the jar. It is case-sensitive.</li>
<li>If this is an <span class="class">Applet</span>, you got the <span class="html">&lt;applet
code=<span class="dq">com.mindprod.mypackage.MyClass.class</span></span> wrong. Perhaps you forgot the
package part of the name or you forgot the <span class="html">.class</span>. The package names in the
jar may not be right. The <span class="html">&lt;applet archive=<span class="dq">myjar.jar</span></span> may not match a jar file containing the needed class.

<br/>
<em>Detail from The Scream, by Edvard Munch</em>
<p><span class="package">java.lang</span>.<span class="class">NoClassDefFoundError:</span> <span class="package">mypackage</span>/ <span class="class">MyClass</span>
<br/>
This one is difficult to track down. It has so many causes. Java is so picky! A misplaced comma, quote,
semicolon, extraneous extension or even the wrong upper/lower case can derail the whole program. I hope
some will implement the <a class="project" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/project/noclassdeffounderror.html">NoClassDefFoundError Amanuensis</a> to make the problem easier to
track down.</p>
<p>Sun explains that it is thrown when Java Virtual Machine or a ClassLoader instance tries to load in
the definition of a class \(as part of a normal method call or as part of creating a new instance using
the new expression \) and no definition of the class could be found. The searched-for class definition
existed when the currently executing class was compiled, but the definition can no longer be found. It is
similar to a <span class="class">ClassNotFoundException</span>. This gives you the hint that a <span class="class">NoClassDefFoundError</span> problem was <strong>not</strong> with caused by a 
<!-- macro Qualified Class.forName class --><!-- generated --><span class="qualified"><span class="class">Class</span>.<span class="method">forName</span></span><!-- /generated by Qualified -->.</p>
<ol><li>Essentially the problem is the place and name where you put the class file, free-standing on disk
or inside a jar, does match the place and name it should have, based on the classpath, the package name
and the class name. Everything is case-sensitive and sensitive to the tiniest typo. Unfortunately,
there is currently no <a class="project" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/project/noclassdeffounderror.html">tool</a> to tell
you where the class should be placed \(usually there are several possibilities \) or where it is now.</li>
<li>You got the class name wrong on the <span class="exe">java.exe</span> command line. It must include
the full package name and class separated by dots, without the <span class="ext">*.class</span> e.g.
<div class="bat">java.exe com.mindprod.converter.Convert</div><strong>not</strong> just the class:
<div class="bat">java.exe Convert</div>Newbies often get in trouble by adding a <span class="ext">*.java</span> or <span class="ext">*.class</span> suffix. In contrast, <span class="exe">javac.exe</span> demands the <span class="ext">*.java</span> extension.</li>
<li>You get an error message like this: <span class="output">Exception in thread <span class="quoted">main</span> java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: XXX/java</span>. When attempting to compile, you
keyed <span class="bat">java.exe XXX.java</span> instead of <span class="bat">javac.exe
XXX.java</span>.</li>
<li>Java can't find the class mentioned. It is missing from the jar or classpath. Java may need
it because it occurs as a class or superclass in a serialised <span class="class">ObjectStream</span>
or because you called a method of that class. You don't find out about the problem at compile
time or even load time. You only find out when you actually go to use that missing class. The missing
class was present when the class referencing it was compiled \(perhaps on somebody else's machine \)
but the missing class is no longer accessible. To fix a vanilla <span class="class">NoClassDefFoundError</span>, search the all the jar files on your machine for the missing
class. <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/searchreplace.html">Funduc Search and Replace</a> will do that. If you
can't find it, scour the web for a download. When you find it, make sure its jar is on the
general classpath, the project classpath, the command line classpath or in the <span class="dir">ext</span> directories of the various <!-- macro Acronym JREs --><!-- generated --><a class="acronymdef" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/jre.html">JREs</a> \(<span class="means"><span class="ac">J</span>ava <span class="ac">R</span>untime <span class="ac">E</span>nvironments</span> \)<!-- /generated by Acronym -->
you have installed. There will be at least two <span class="dir">ext</span> directories.
<div class="see"><a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/classpath.html">classpath</a></div></li>
<li>Three diagnostic tools you may find helpful:
<ol><li>To dump the classpath that you are actually using at some point in your code insert: You must
first determine if the classpath is correct with:
<!-- macro JDisplay classpath.getclasspath.javafrag --><!-- generated --><iframe class="jdisplay" height="461" src="snippet/iframe/classpath.getclasspath.javafrag.htm" style="overflow:scroll" width="800"></iframe><!-- /generated by JDisplay --></li>
<li>If you have a jar or more than one class, assign each class to a package! Package-less classes
are for one-shot, single-class throw-away experiments only.</li>
<li>Then when you are sure the jar or directory you want is truly on the classpath \(it is not
sufficient for the directory that the jar is in be on the classpath \), then check the contents of
the jar with <span class="exe">jarlook</span> to make sure your package/class is in there, spelled
precisely, including case. You can <a class="download" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/products1.html#JARLOOK">download
jarlook</a> with source.</li>
<li><a class="download" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/products1.html#JARCHECK">download jarcheck</a> as well. It will
help you detect problems with unexpected target versions of class files in your jars.</li></ol></li>
<li>Recall that reconstitution of serialized files uses <span class="class">Class</span>. <span class="method">forName</span> to instantiate all the classes buried in the files. <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/genjar.html">Genjar</a> or equivalent does not know to include these classes in your jar. It is up to
you to include all the classes you need manually. You will keep getting the dreaded <span class="class">NoClassDefFoundError</span> until you have nailed them all.</li>
<li>Look for a typo in spelling the class file name in the file or in the command line invoking its
main method. Copy/paste to make sure they are absolutely identical including case.</li>
<li>Check your <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/classpath.html">classpath</a>. Make sure you used semicolons or
colons as appropriate. Don't specify null fields in your classpath, e.g. two semicolons in a
row.</li>
<li>The problem is essentially either the class is not on the classpath or the classpath is wrong. You
must first determine if the classpath is correct with:
<!-- macro JDisplay classpath.getclasspath.javafrag --><!-- generated --><iframe class="jdisplay" height="461" src="snippet/iframe/classpath.getclasspath.javafrag.htm" style="overflow:scroll" width="800"></iframe><!-- /generated by JDisplay --></li>
<li>If your program used to work and it <span class="quoted">suddenly</span> stopped working, did you
upgrade your JDK/JRE? If so, you likely forgot to copy over the jars to the <span class="dir">
<!-- macro JRE path --><!-- generated --><span class="path"><span class="drive">C:</span>\<span class="dir">Program Files</span>\<span class="dir">java</span>\<span class="dir">jre1.8.0_131</span>\</span><!-- /generated by JRE -->\lib\ext</span> and <span class="dir">

<li>You wrote some code like this:
<!-- macro JDisplay errormessages.exceptionininitializererror.javafrag --><!-- generated --><pre class="java"><span class="commentslashslash">// one way to trigger an ExceptionInInitializerError</span>

<span class="class">Exception</span>, which your code may not be prepared to handle. When your code
later goes to use the class, you will get a <span class="class">NoClassDefFoundException</span>.</li>
<li>If you see the phrase <span class="quoted">wrong name</span> in the error message, it means you are
not consistently naming the <span class="package">packagename</span>. <span class="class">ClassName</span> everywhere. Perhaps you left off the packagename, or got the case wrong, or
made a typo in either the package or class name.</li>
<li>If you have two packages that use classes from each other, each jar must have all the classes of
the other package that it uses, or that it uses indirectly uses.
<div class="see"><a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/dependencies.html">dependencies</a></div></li>
<li>You must put the <span class="parm">-classpath</span> option before the class name on the java
command line. To remember the order, you can think of it like this. <span class="exe">Java.exe</span>
needs to know the classpath before it can search for the class.</li>
<li>You got package name wrong at the top of the source file, or left it out entirely. It does not
match the one when you built the jar. It is case-sensitive.</li>
<li>If this is an <span class="class">Applet</span>, you got the <span class="html">&lt;applet
code=<span class="dq">com.mindprod.mypackage.MyClass.class</span></span> wrong. Perhaps you forgot the
package part of the name or you forgot the <span class="html">.class</span>. The package names in the
jar may not be right. The <span class="html">&lt;applet archive=<span class="dq">myjar.jar</span></span> may not match a jar file containing the needed class.

u: (nullpointerexception)
\<div id="title">What is the NullPointerException?</div>
The NullPointerException happens when you try to call a method on an object that is either equal to null or hasn't been given a value yet. For example, look at the following code:
<div class="mlcode">
private Jeroo jeroo;

public void act() {
&nbsp;   jeroo.hop(); //Line A
&nbsp;   Jeroo jeroo2 = null;
&nbsp;   jeroo2.hop(); //Line B 
</div>
In the class shown above, both lines A and B will cause NullPointerExceptions. On line A, we try to a method on an object that hasn't been given a value and on line B, we try to call a method on an object that is set equal to null. Make sure that all your objects have real non-null values and this should fix your NullPointerException. You can also ask me for help on debugging a NullPointerException.

# Old null pointer exception explanation.
u: (0=1)
If you try to execute a piece of code like this when <span class="var">s</span> is null you will get a
<span class="class">NullPointerException</span>.

To learn about exceptions in general and try/catch to recover from them, see <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/exception.html">exceptions</a>. Here are some of the possible causes:
<ul><li>A reference variable is null, when you used it to access a field or method.</li>
<li>Autounboxing can make <span class="class">NullPointerException</span>s hard to track down. Innocent
looking code like <span class="k">int</span> <span class="var">result</span> = <span class="method">getResult</span> \(\); can throw a <span class="class">NullPointerException</span> if
autounboxing is hiding what is really happening, namely <span class="k">int</span> <span class="var">result</span> = <span class="method">getResult</span> \(\).<span class="method">intValue</span> \(\);
It will fail if <span class="method">getResult</span> returns <span class="k">null</span> instead of an
<span class="class">Integer</span> object.</li>
<li>Examine the stack trace to figure out where in the code it happening and how you got there. The
stack trace shows the exact line the problem was detected \(not necessarily the line at fault though \).
That gives you a clue to get started. You can put some code of the form:
<!-- macro JDisplay errormessages.example106.javafrag --><!-- generated --><pre class="java"><span class="commentslashslash">// simple debugging code to check for null variables before</span>
<span class="commentslashslash">// they trigger a NullPointerException</span>

   <span class="fence1"> \{</span>
   <span class="var">out</span><span class="op">.</span><span class="method">println</span><span class="fence1"> \(</span> <span class="string">"p was null"</span> <span class="fence1"> \)</span><span class="sc">;</span>

<span class="k">assert </span><span class="var">p </span><span class="op">!= </span><span class="k">null </span><span class="op">: </span><span class="string">"p was null"</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre><!-- /generated by JDisplay --></li>
<li>Narrow it down to the precise variable giving the trouble. Then you have to sit and think about
<strong>why</strong> that variable is null. The real problem could be much earlier in the code and the
problem propagated through to the point where it eventually surfaced as an exception. You must figure
out where it was supposed to be set and have a look at that code and why it is failing. Most of the
time you simply forgot to initialise. The easiest way to track the causes down is using a source-level
<a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/debugger.html">debugger</a> such as <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/intellij.html">Intellij Idea</a> or <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/eclipse.html">Eclipse</a> You can trace
the flow of execution, or examine the state of the universe at the time of failure.</li>
<li>If you don't want to use a debugger, pepper your code with assertions to track down just what
is <!-- macro JDisplay errormessages.example107.javafrag --><!-- generated --><pre class="java"><span class="commentslashslash">// typical debugging code that prints a message if thing is null.</span>
<span class="method">ensureNotNull</span><span class="fence1"> \(</span> <span class="var">thing</span><span class="op">, </span><span class="string">"thing"</span> <span class="fence1"> \)</span><span class="sc">;</span>

<span class="commentslashslash">// in JDK 1.4+ you can also do that with an assert.</span>
<span class="k">assert </span><span class="var">thing </span><span class="op">!= </span><span class="k">null </span><span class="op">: </span><span class="string">"thing is null"</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre><!-- /generated by JDisplay --></li>
<li>Your <span class="method">ensureNotNull</span> \( <span class="interface">Object</span> <span class="var">toTest</span> \) method might print an error message if <span class="var">toTest</span> is null,
then throw a new <span class="class">NullPointerException</span>. By making <span class="method">ensureNotNull</span> <span class="k">final</span> and using an <span class="java"><span class="k">if</span> \(<span class="constant">DEBUG</span> \)</span> inside <span class="method">ensureNotNull</span>, the inline expansions will have no overhead in production and you can
leave the debugging assertions in place to be reactivated later if ever needed.</li>
<li>Most commonly you forgot statements of the form: <span class="java">myArray = new int \[ 10 \];</span>
or <span class="java">myThing = new Thing \(\);</span> See the <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/array.html#ARRAYINITGOTCHAS">array initialisation gotchas</a>. These are the most common of runtime
errors.</li>
<li>You may not call <span class="method">getParameter</span> in the <span class="class">Applet</span>
constructor. Move that code to <span class="method">init</span>.</li>
<li>Sometimes the problem is redeclaring a local variable with the same name as an instance variable.
You might have initialised one but not the other. Beware having two variables with the same name, one
local and one instance, It is very easy to do inadvertently and <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/javacexe.html">
Javac</a> will not warn you, though <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/jikes.html">Jikes</a> will e.g.

instance variable and poof, your values are lost as soon as the local goes out of scope, leaving the
instance version null. This is the way I most commonly create <span class="class">NullPointerException</span>s for myself, when I convert a local variable to an instance one
when I have to break a method up that uses the variable and forget to take out the local declaration.</li>
<li>Be very careful calling any methods inside your constructors. If subclasses override them, you will
be invoking the subclass's version, which may be attempting to use fields that have not been
initialised yet. You won't get a warning message! The problem usually shows up as puzzling
<span class="class">NullPointerException</span>s. The way out is to move code out of the constructor,
often to the <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/addnotify.html">addNotify</a> method. However, <span class="method">addNotify</span> can get in analogous problem to the constructor since it too is overridden
and it may use overridden methods.</li>
<li>If the problem is in Oracle's code that you call or indirectly call, \(i.e. no source code
line number \) look at the place in your code where you trigger the chain of calls. Insert some debug
code there to examine the parameters and the fields in any objects you pass. If you can't track
it from that, use a source code debugger like Eclipse that lets you follow program flow inside
Oracle's code. For example, your code creates an event, asking it to operate on some null
component and the problem does not show up until later when the event is dispatched and handled by
Oracle's code.</li>
<li>The <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/nice.html">Nice</a> language manages to detect <span class="class">NullPointerException</span>s at compile time instead of run time the way Java does.</li></ul>

u: STACK_OVERFLOW_ERROR (stackoverflowerror) 
\<h2>What is the StackOverflowError?</h2>
This error mainly happens when you have a method that calls itself. This is called recursion. If you are intentionally trying to write a recursive function, make sure you have a valid base case so that the recursion can end. If you aren't trying to make a recursive method or you didn't know what recursion is, don't call a method inside itself. Make sure you are also not creating an object in its own constructor.
<div class="mlcode">
public boolean isOnEdge() {
&nbsp;   return isOnEdge() && this.isFacing(EAST);
}
</div>
The above code will give a StackOverflowError because we are calling <code>isOnEdge()</code> inside itself. For more information, check <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/recursion.html">this</a> out or ask me some other questions!

execute methods on it. I suspect there is something broken in Netscape and System.loadLibrary. I have
fooled around with it for months and still cannot get it to behave reliably. See notes under <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/jni.html">JNI</a></li></ul>

u: (unsupportedclassversionerror) You used a method that your <!-- macro Acronym JVM --><!-- generated --><span class="acronym"><abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr></span><!-- /generated by Acronym -->
