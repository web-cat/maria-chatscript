	a: METHOD_NOT_TESTED ()
	 To test a method, you will want to make a new test method. If the method you need to test is called <code>method()</code>, you should create a test method called <code>testMethod()</code> and call <code>method()</code> somewhere in that test method. Inside the test method, you'll need to do 3 things: (1) set things up, (2) call the method you're testing, and (3) assert something.

	<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="answer"></div>
		#! Give me an example.
		b: (example)
		First, go to your test class. Then make a new method that looks like this:
		<div class="mlcode">
		public void testMethod() {<br/>
		&nbsp;   //Part 1: Set up a situation to test.<br/>
		&nbsp;   //Part 2: Call the method you are testing.<br/>
		&nbsp;   //Part 3: Make assertions about what should happen.<br/>
		}<br/>
		</div>
		<ul id="choices">
		<li>Go on.</li>
		<li>Stop.</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="start-extended-example"></div>
			#! Stop.
			c: (stop)
			Will do.
			<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="early-stop-extended-example"></div>
					
			#! Go on.
			c: (go on)
			Great, now that you've got that done, you'll want to look at the method you're testing. Pick one situation that you want to test. For example, this is the method I'm testing. It's in a Jeroo subclass:
			<div class="mlcode">
			public void method() {<br/>
			&nbsp;   \if (this.getGridX() == 2) {<br/>
			&nbsp;       this.hop();<br/>
			&nbsp;   }<br/>
			}<br/>
			</div>
			This method has two situations to test: when the Jeroo hops and when it doesn't.
			<ul id="choices">
			<li>Go on.</li>
			<li>Stop.</li>
			</ul>
				#! Stop.
				d: (stop)
				Will do.
				<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="early-stop-extended-example"></div>
						
				#! Go on.
				d: (go on)
				First let's test a situation when the Jeroo will hop. For the Jeroo to hop, its x-coordinate must be 2. So, let's make that happen. In the test, we want our Jeroo to be at x = 2. In order for it to be anywhere, we need to create it.
				<div class="mlcode">
				public void testMethod() {<br/>
				&nbsp;   //Part 1: Set up a situation to test.<br/>
				&nbsp;   JerroSubclass jeroo = new JerooSubclass();<br/>
				&nbsp;   //Part 2: Call the method you are testing.<br/>
				&nbsp;   //Part 3: Make assertions about what should happen.<br/>
				}<br/>
				</div>
				<ul id="choices">
				<li>Go on.</li>
				<li>Stop.</li>
				</ul>
					#! Stop.
					e: (stop)
					Will do.
					<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="early-stop-extended-example"></div>
							
					#! Go on.
					e: (go on)
					Next, we need to create a world for this Jeroo live in. We'll also add him to the world.
					<div class="mlcode">
					public void testMethod() {<br/>
					&nbsp;   //Part 1: Set up a situation to test.<br/>
					&nbsp;   JerroSubclass jeroo = new JerooSubclass();<br/>
					&nbsp;   World world = new World();<br/>
					&nbsp;   //Part 2: Call the method you are testing.<br/>
					&nbsp;   //Part 3: Make assertions about what should happen.<br/>
					}<br/>
					</div>
					<ul id="choices">
					<li>Go on.</li>
					<li>Stop.</li>
					</ul>
						#! Stop.
						f: (stop)
						Will do.
						<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="early-stop-extended-example"></div>
								
						#! Go on.
						f: (go on)
						Great! Now can finally actually add the Jeroo so it's x position is 2! Let's do that now:
						<div class="mlcode">
						public void testMethod() {<br/>
						&nbsp;   //Part 1: Set up a situation to test.<br/>
						&nbsp;   JerroSubclass jeroo = new JerooSubclass();<br/>
						&nbsp;   World world = new World();<br/>
						&nbsp;   world.add(jeroo, 2, 2);<br/>
						&nbsp;   //Part 2: Call the method you are testing.<br/>
						&nbsp;   //Part 3: Make assertions about what should happen.<br/>
						}<br/>
						</div>
						<ul id="choices">
						<li>Go on.</li>
						<li>Stop.</li>
						</ul>
							#! Stop.
							g: (stop)
							Will do.
							<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="early-stop-extended-example"></div>
									
							#! Go on.
							g: (go on)
							Awesome! Now, all our set up is done. The if statement will be true, so now we can actually call the method we're testing. That's part 2!
							<div class="mlcode">
							public void testMethod() {<br/>
							&nbsp;   //Part 1: Set up a situation to test.<br/>
							&nbsp;   JerroSubclass jeroo = new JerooSubclass();<br/>
							&nbsp;   World world = new World();<br/>
							&nbsp;   world.add(jeroo, 2, 2);<br/>
							&nbsp;   //Part 2: Call the method you are testing.<br/>
							&nbsp;   jeroo.method();<br/>
							&nbsp;   //Part 3: Make assertions about what should happen.<br/>
							}<br/>
							</div>
							<ul id="choices">
							<li>Go on.</li>
							<li>Stop.</li>
							</ul>
								#! Stop.
								h: (stop)
								Will do.
								<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="early-stop-extended-example"></div>
										
								#! Go on.
								h: (go on)
								Part 2 is very easy. Now, we can move onto part 3. We need to assert something. So, our method says that if the Jeroo is at x = 2, it will hop. So our Jeroo should have hopped! We can assert that by asserting about the Jeroo's location:
								<div class="mlcode">
								public void testMethod() {<br/>
								&nbsp;   //Part 1: Set up a situation to test.<br/>
								&nbsp;   JerroSubclass jeroo = new JerooSubclass();<br/>
								&nbsp;   World world = new World();<br/>
								&nbsp;   world.add(jeroo, 2, 2);<br/>
								&nbsp;   //Part 2: Call the method you are testing.<br/>
								&nbsp;   jeroo.method();<br/>
								&nbsp;   //Part 3: Make assertions about what should happen.<br/>
								&nbsp;   assertEquals(3, jeroo.getGridX());<br/>
								}<br/>
								</div>
								<ul id="choices">
								<li>Go on.</li>
								<li>Stop.</li>
								</ul>
									#! Stop.
									i: (stop)
									Will do.
									<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="early-stop-extended-example"></div>
											
									#! Go on.
									i: (go on)
									Yay! We did it! That's our full test method. Because our method had an if statement, we would also need to make another test where the if statement was false instead of true (so put the Jeroo at a different x-coordinate).

		#! Give me an example.
		b: (example)
		Let's say I have this code in a class called <code>Person</code>, with line 3 being highlighted by Web-CAT for not being testing. Then, I will need to write a test where I create a situation where the if condition is true.
		<div class="mlcode">
		public void myMethod() {<br/>
		&nbsp;   \if (this.getAge() == 21)      // line 1<br/>
		&nbsp;   {    <br/>
		&nbsp;        this.canDrink = true;    // line 3<br/>

			#! Go on.
			c: (go on)
			Ok, so in your test, I want <code>getAge()</code> to return 21 so that my if condition is true. In my case, I can do that by using another method I wrote called <code>setAge()</code> but in your code it might be a bit more complicated. Think about what methods you can call to get the if condition to be true. Here's my test:
			<div class="mlcode">
			public void testMyMethod() {<br/>
			&nbsp;   // Setup the situation I want.<br/>
			&nbsp;   Person tom = new Person();<br/>
			&nbsp;   tom.setAge(21);    // This will make my if condition true!<br/>
			&nbsp;   // Call the method I'm testing.<br/>
			&nbsp;   tom.myMethod();<br/>
			&nbsp;   // Assert something.<br/>
			&nbsp;   assertTrue(tom.canDrink());<br/>
			}<br/>

<li>A while/do-while loop.</li>
</ul>
	#! An if statement.
	a: IF_NOT_TESTED (if)
	To test an if statement, where you need to test all the different possibilities for your if condition. For example, if your if condition looks like this <code>if (this.canMove() && this.age == 2)</code>, there are 2 conditions (the things separated by <code>&&</code>'s or <code>||</code>'s) and so you need to test 2+1 = 3 possibilities.<br/>
	So, first, how many conditions do you have?
	<ul id="choices">
	<li>Just 1</li>
	<li>More than 1</li>
	</ul>
		#! More than 1

		That's a little sad, but I'm sure we can get through this. Is the if statement using and's or or's?

		<li>ANDs</li>
		<li>ORs</li>
		<li>A combination of both.</li>
		</ul>
			#! ANDs
			c: TEST_AND (ands)
			Ok so, if you have N conditions in your if statement, you'll need to write N+1 tests. For and's, one of these tests will be when all of the conditions are true so that whole if statement is true. In this test, the code inside the if statement should be run. Then, you need N tests, one where each condition is false and rest are true.

						&nbsp;   tom.setAge(10);            // First condition is true!<br/>
						&nbsp;   tom.setIsInCollege(false); // Second condition is false!<br/>
						&nbsp;   // Call the method I'm testing.<br/>

							Finally, we can do the test where the first condition is false and the second is true. So, we need <code>getAge()</code> to not be less than 18 and <code>isInCollege</code> to be true. We're testing when the second condition is the deciding factor. Here's our test:
							<div class="mlcode">
							public void testMyMethodInCollege() {<br/>
							&nbsp;   // Setup the situation I want.<br/>
							&nbsp;   Person tom = new Person();<br/>
							&nbsp;   tom.setAge(25);           // First condition is false!<br/>
							&nbsp;   tom.setIsInCollege(true); // Second condition is true!<br/>
							&nbsp;   // Call the method I'm testing.<br/>
							&nbsp;   tom.myMethod();<br/>
							&nbsp;   // Assert something.<br/>
							&nbsp;   assertTrue(tom.isInSchool());<br/>
							}<br/>
							</div>
							<ul id="choices">
							<li>Go on.</li>
							<li>Stop.</li>
							</ul>
								#! Stop.
								h: (stop)
								Will do.
								<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="early-stop-extended-example"></div>
								
								#! Go on.
								h: (go on)
								Now we're done! We have all 3 tests! If you have more than 3 conditions, simply repeat this process for the other conditions, making testing where each condition is true and the others are false.
								<ul id="choices">
								^feedback_options()
								</ul>
								<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="example"></div>
			
			#! A combination of both.
			c: (combination)
			That's really sad. This makes testing a lot harder, but we can do it! So, the best way to deal with combine and's and or's is to break it up into just one or the other. Let's say we have a condition that looks like this:
			<div class="mlcode">
			\if (a && b && c || d || e && f)<br/>
			</div>
			We can break this up into conditions that are just and's or just or's. 
			<ul id="choices">
			<li>Go on.</li>
			<li>Stop.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="start-extended-example"></div>
				#! Stop.
				d: (stop)
				Will do.
				<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="early-stop-extended-example"></div>
				
				#! Go on.
				d: (go on)
				So, looking at this, it seems like it would be easier to break this up into just and's. We can do that with parentheses:
				<div class="mlcode">
				\if ( a && b && (c || d || e) && f)<br/>
				</div>
				Now, we only need to things that are on the outermost level of parentheses. In this case, that's and's. 
				<ul id="choices">
				<li>Go on.</li>
				<li>Stop.</li>
				</ul>
					#! Stop.
					e: (stop)
					Will do.
					<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="early-stop-extended-example"></div>
					
					#! Go on.
					e: (go on)
					Because we're testing and's, we need one test where every part of the condition is true and 4 tests where each part of the condition is false and the rest of the parts are true. So, here are our tests:
					<ul>
					<li> <code>a</code> is true, <code>b</code> is true, <code>(c || d || e)</code> is true, <code>f</code> is true</li>
					<li> <code>a</code> is false, <code>b</code> is true, <code>(c || d || e)</code> is true, <code>f</code> is true</li>
					<li> <code>a</code> is true, <code>b</code> is false, <code>(c || d || e)</code> is true, <code>f</code> is true</li>
					<li> <code>a</code> is true, <code>b</code> is true, <code>(c || d || e)</code> is false, <code>f</code> is true</li>
					<li> <code>a</code> is true, <code>b</code> is true, <code>(c || d || e)</code> is true, <code>f</code> is false</li>
					</ul>
					<ul id="choices">
					<li>Go on.</li>
					<li>Stop.</li>
					</ul>
						#! Stop.
						f: (stop)
						Will do.
						<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="early-stop-extended-example"></div>
						
						#! Go on.
						f: (go on)
						We're almost done, but we've forgotten something! There are multiple ways for <code>(c || d || e)</code> to be true! So, we need to add a few more tests. We only need to add these extra tests to one of the cases listed before, so we can add these tests to the case where the whole condition is true:
						<code>a</code> is true, <code>b</code> is true, <code>(c || d || e)</code> is true, <code>f</code> is true. 
						<ul id="choices">
						<li>Go on.</li>
						<li>Stop.</li>
						</ul>
							#! Stop.
							g: (stop)
							Will do.
							<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="early-stop-extended-example"></div>
							
							#! Go on.
							g: (go on)
							Let's think about how <code>(c || d || e)</code> can be true. Now, you'll want to think about how we test or statements. We'll want one case where each part of the condition is true and the rest are false. It's true in these cases:
							<ul>
							<li><code>c</code> is true, <code>c</code> is false, <code>c</code> is false</li>
							<li><code>c</code> is false, <code>c</code> is true, <code>c</code> is false</li>
							<li><code>c</code> is false, <code>c</code> is false, <code>c</code> is true</li>
							</ul>
							<ul id="choices">
							<li>Go on.</li>
							<li>Stop.</li>
							</ul>
								#! Stop.
								h: (stop)
								Will do.
								<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="early-stop-extended-example"></div>
								
								#! Go on.
								h: (go on)
								Nice. So, now we can combine it altogether. Altogether, we'll need tests where:
								<ul>
								<li> <code>a</code> is true, <code>b</code> is true, <code>(c || d || e)</code> is true (<code>c</code> is true, <code>d</code> is false, and <code>e</code> is false), <code>f</code> is true</li>
								<li> <code>a</code> is true, <code>b</code> is true, <code>(c || d || e)</code> is true (<code>c</code> is false, <code>d</code> is true, and <code>e</code> is false), <code>f</code> is true</li>
								<li> <code>a</code> is true, <code>b</code> is true, <code>(c || d || e)</code> is true (<code>c</code> is false, <code>d</code> is false, and <code>e</code> is true), <code>f</code> is true</li>

		Nice. You are very lucky. You only need to test 2 possibilities: one where the condition of your if statement is true and one where the condition of your if statement is true. This means you'll have to set up 2 different situations in 2 different tests: 1 situation where that condition is true and one where that situation is false.

			#! Give me an example.
			c: (example)
			Let's say I have this code in a class called <code>Person</code>, and I want to test all the possibilities for the if statement on line 1. Then, I will need to write two tests: one where I create a situation where the if condition is true and one where it is false.
			<div class="mlcode">
			public void myMethod() {<br/>
			&nbsp;   \if (this.getAge() == 21)      // line 1<br/>
			&nbsp;   {    <br/>
			&nbsp;       this.canDrink = true;    <br/>
			&nbsp;   }<br/>
			&nbsp;   else <br/>
			&nbsp;   {<br/>
			&nbsp;       this.canDrink = false;<br/>

				<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="early-stop-extended-example"></div>
				
				#! Go on.
				d: (go on)
				Ok, let's start with the case where the if condition is true. So in the test, I want <code>getAge()</code> to return 21 so that my if condition is true. In my case, I can do that by using another method I wrote called <code>setAge()</code> but in your code it might be a bit more complicated. Think about what methods you can call to get the if condition to be true. Here's my test:
				<div class="mlcode">
				public void testMyMethodCanDrink() {<br/>
				&nbsp;   // Setup the situation I want.<br/>
				&nbsp;   Person tom = new Person();<br/>
				&nbsp;   tom.setAge(21);    // This will make my if condition true!<br/>
				&nbsp;   // Call the method I'm testing.<br/>
				&nbsp;   tom.myMethod();<br/>
				&nbsp;   // Assert something.<br/>
				&nbsp;   assertTrue(tom.canDrink());<br/>
				}<br/>
				</div>
				<ul id="choices">
				<li>Go on.</li>
				<li>Stop.</li>
				</ul>
					#! Stop.
					e: (stop)
					Will do.
					<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="early-stop-extended-example"></div>
					
					#! Go on.
					e: (go on)
					Now I need the false case. So in the test, I want <code>getAge()</code> to not return 21 so that my if condition is false. Here's my second test:
					<div class="mlcode">
					public void testMyMethodCannotDrink() {<br/>
					&nbsp;   // Setup the situation I want.<br/>
					&nbsp;   Person tom = new Person();<br/>
					&nbsp;   tom.setAge(10);    // This will make my if condition false!<br/>
					&nbsp;   // Call the method I'm testing.<br/>
					&nbsp;   tom.myMethod();<br/>
					&nbsp;   // Assert something.<br/>
					&nbsp;   assertFalse(tom.canDrink());<br/>
					}<br/>
					</div>

	#! A for loop.
	a: FOR_NOT_TESTED (for)

		&nbsp;   {    <br/>
		&nbsp;       this.age++;<br/>
		&nbsp;   }<br/>

		</div>
		I need 2 tests, 1 where the while loop doesn't run at all (so <code>age</code> starts out not being less than 18) and 1 where the loop runs at least once (so <code>age</code> starts out being less than 18).

					That makes testing things a bit more tricky. In that case, you'll want to think of the line like an if statement and test it like one. Let's say we have this code:
					<div class="mlcode">
					public void myMethod() {<br/>
					&nbsp;   this.canDrive = this.age == 18 && this.hasLicense ? true : false;<br/>
					}<br/>
					</div>
					We can think of this as an if statement!
					<ul id="choices">
					<li>Go on.</li>
					<li>Stop.</li>
					</ul>
						#! Stop.
						f: (stop)
						Will do.
						<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="early-stop-extended-example"></div>
						
						#! Go on.
						f: (go on)
						As an if statement, this code would look like this:
						<div class="mlcode">
						public void myMethod() <br/>
						{<br/>
						&nbsp;   \if (this.age == 18 && this.hasLicense) <br/>
						&nbsp;   {<br/>
						&nbsp;       this.canDrive = true;<br/>
						&nbsp;   }<br/>
						&nbsp;   else <br/>
						&nbsp;   {<br/>
						&nbsp;       this.canDrive = false;<br/>
						&nbsp;   }<br/>
						}<br/>
						</div>
						We don't actually have to rewrite the code to look like this, but we can think about it like this. Now, you just need to write tests the exact same way you would for an if statement!

If your normal class is called <code>SomeClass</code>, you should name your test class <code>SomeClassTest</code>. Make sure the word "Test" is at the end.

#! how to test transformablepicture constructor
u: (how * test * constructor)
To test a constructor, you simply have to call the constructor somewhere in you test code. If the constructor sets field values, you should probably assert that the field values are set correctly. 
<ul id="choices">
<li>Give me an example!</li>
<li>Ok, I got it.</li>

<div class="feedback-info" data-feedback-type="answer"></div>
	#! Ok, I got it.
	a: (~yes)
	Nice!

	#! Give me an example!
	a: (example)
	For example, if I have this constructor and method:
	<div class="mlcode">
	public MyObject(int param) {<br/>
	nbsp;   this.field = param;<br/>
	}<br/>
<br/>
	public int getField() {<br/>
	nbsp;   return this.field;<br/>
	}<br/>
	</div>
	I can test it by making a test method like this:
	<div class="mlcode">
	public void testMyObject() {<br/>
	nbsp;   MyObject obj = new MyObject(2);<br/>
	nbsp;   assertEquals(2, obj.getField();<br/>

#! how do i test a for loop with multiple conditions?

You probably shouldn't have multiple conditions in a for loop. It makes your code harder to read. Try to get rid of the extra condition or use a while loop instead.

If have made a test but Web-CAT says you don't have a test, this may be because you named the test class or methods wrong. If you have a class called <code>Thing</code>, the test class must be named <code>ThingTest</code> and if you want to test a method called <code>doStuff()</code>, the test method must be called <code>testDoSomething()</code>.

u: HOW_BREAK_UP_LONG_LINE (break up * line)
If Web-CAT is giving you an error saying you need to break up a line because it is longer than 80 characters, you can usually break it up anywhere that there's whitespace. Like this. You can also break it up right after commas and right after parentheses. If you have a string that's over 80 characters, you can do this:
<div class="mlcode">
// Bad<br/>
String str = "I am a very long string and I need to be broken up onto 2 lines because I am so long.";<br/>
<br/>
// Good<br/>
String str = "I am a very long string and I need to be broken up onto " +<br/>
	"2 lines because I am so long.";<br/>

#! how do i compare doubles with assertequals
u: ASSERTEQUALS_WITH_DOUBLE (how * [compare use call] * [doubles double] * with * ~assertequals)
You cannot compare doubles directly. Because of the way the computer stores doubles, two doubles that we would consider equal may actually be different (by a very small factor, like 0.0000000001). To use assertEquals() with doubles, add a third parameter that is your margin of error. Basically, the doubles need to be at least that close to be considered equal. Here is an example:
<div class="mlcode">
assertEquals(0.2, variable, 0.000001);<br/>
