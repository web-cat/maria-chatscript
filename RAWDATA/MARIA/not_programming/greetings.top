	Hi. I'm Maria! Ask me something about computer science!
	

#! what is your name
u: ( what is your name ) 
My name is Maria. I am the Virtual Teaching Assistant for Web-CAT.


#! who are you
u: ( who are you ) 
I am Maria. I am the Virtual Teaching Assistant for Web-CAT.


u: (who made you) 
I was made by people here at VT to help you learn!


#! what can i ask you?
u: (what * ask you)
You can ask me about things related to Java, programming, or debugging. Some popular topics are random numbers, arrays, loops, testing, inheritance, errors, and exceptions! You can also give me feedback! Sadly, right now, you can't ask me project specific questions. Try to make your question general.
<ul id="choices">
<li>How do I generate random numbers?</li>
<li>What are arrays?</li>
<li>How do I make a for loop?</li>
<li>How do I test an if statement?</li>
<li>How does inheritance work?</li>
<li>What is the null pointer exception?</li>
<li>I want to give feedback on this system!</li>
</ul>

u: (help)
I will certainly try. Sadly, I can't give project-specific help, but I can give you general help with test, errors, and Java. What do you need help with?
<ul id="choices">
<li>Testing.</li>
<li>Errors and exceptions.</li>
<li>Doing something in Java.</li>
<li>Something else.</li>
</ul>
	a: (testing)
	^reuse(~testing.HOW_TEST)

	a: ([errors exceptions])
	What error are you getting?
		b: ()
		^input(what is %originalinput error)

	a: (doing * something * java)
	Sure! I'm great at answering those types of questions. Ask me a question like "How do I make a for loop?"

	a: (something else)
	I might be able to help you. Just ask a question. Try to keep it general, like "How do I make a for loop?" and not "How can I make the hopRight() method?"


#! what am i doing wrong?

	Wonderful. What can I help you with today?

	#! bad 
	a: ([~emosad ~no bad "not good" "not well"])
	Sorry to hear. I know when I'm feeling down answering questions about programming always makes me feel better. Maybe you should try asking one?

Yo.
