#! flip a coin
u: (flip a coin)
$rand = %rand
Sure thing boss. 
^refine()
	a: ($rand=1)
	It landed on its side... weird.
	a: ()
	[It was heads.][Looks like tails to me.]

#! let's play rock paper scissors
#! i want to play rock paper scissors
u: (play rock paper scissors)
$rand=%rand % 3
Ok. You go first....
	a: RPS ([rock paper scissors])
	^refine()
		b: (rock $rand=0)
		I had paper. Ha! I win.
		b: (rock $rand=1)
		I had scissors. Dang. You win.
		b: (rock $rand=2)
		I also had rock. Guess no one wins.
		b: (paper $rand=0)
		I also had paper. Guess I'll have to win next time.
		b: (paper $rand=1)
		I had scissors. That's a win for me and a LOSS for YOU!
		b: (paper $rand=2)
		I had rock. Let's not talk about it. Want to ask a Java question?
		b: (scissors $rand=0)
		I had paper. I... um... I lost. I'm so sad right now.
		b: (scissors $rand=1)
		I also had scissors. Let's just say I won.
		b: (scissors $rand=2)
		I had rock. Guess what? I won!
	a: ()
	I'm serious. I literally can't go at the same time as you. Don't worry, I won't cheat.
		b: ()
		$rand=%rand % 3
		^reuse(RPS)
		
#! i want to play high low
#! let's play hi lo
u: (play ["high low" "hi lo" "higher lower"])
$rand=%rand
Ok, I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. Take a guess! $rand
	a: GUESS (_~number)
	$guess=_0
	^refine()
		b: ($guess<$rand)
		Higher! 
			c: (_~number)
			$guess=_0
			^reuse(GUESS)
		b: ($guess>$rand)
		Lower!
			c: (_~number)
			$guess=_0
			^reuse(GUESS)
		b: ($guess=$rand)
		You got it!
