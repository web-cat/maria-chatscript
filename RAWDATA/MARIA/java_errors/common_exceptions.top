In Java, the most common cause of the ArithmeticExcpetion is trying to divide by zero. Make sure you're not dividing by zero!

	Make sure none of the variables you're diving by can be zero. For example, the following code will cause an error because <code>i</code> is zero at some point!

The StringIndexOutOfBoundsException happens when you try to use an index of  string that does not exist. For example, if I have <code>String str = "012";</code>, then <code>str</code> has a length of 3 and the valid indices are 0, 1, and 2. I can't say <code>str.charAt(3)</code> or <code>str.substring(-1)</code> because the indices 3 and -1 do not exist.

The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException happens when you try to access an array at an index that doesn't exist in the array. This can happen if the index you try to access is too big or too small. If you create an array like <code>int[] array = new int[10]</code>, then saying <code>array[-1] = 1</code> or <code>array[11] = 1</code> will give you an error because the array is indexed from 0 to 9. If you are accessing the array in a for loop, make sure you aren't using a <= instead of <.

	The valid indices of an array are all the whole numbers from 0 to the length of the array minus 1. For example, if I make an array <code>int[] array = new int[n]</code>, the valid indices are all the whole numbers from 0 to n-1.

The NumberFormatException happens when you try to convert a string to a number, but the string isn't a valid number! For example, if you have <code>String str = "12p"</code> and you try to call <code>Integer.parseInt(str)</code>, you'll get a NumberFormatException because <code>"12p"</code> is not a number.

The StackOverflowError usually happens when you call a method or constructor inside of itself. It's also usually very easy to find because the error message should tell you exactly where the problem is. Simple look at the line number where the error happened and make sure that line doesn't call the method that line is in. You may also have meant to say <code>super.methodName()</code> instead of <code>this.methodName()</code>.

	a: (tell me more)
	\<h2>What is the StackOverflowError?</h2>
	This error mainly happens when you have a method that calls itself. This is called recursion. If you are intentionally trying to write a recursive function, make sure you have a valid base case so that the recursion can end. If you aren't trying to make a recursive method or you didn't know what recursion is, don't call a method inside itself. Make sure you are also not creating an object in its own constructor.
	<div class="mlcode">
	public boolean isOnEdge() {
	&nbsp;   return isOnEdge() && this.isFacing(EAST);
	}
	</div>
	The above code will give a StackOverflowError because we are calling <code>isOnEdge()</code> inside itself. For more information, check <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/recursion.html">this</a> out or ask me some other questions!

	<br/>
	This one is a bitch to track down. It has so many causes. Java is so picky! A misplaced comma, quote,
	semicolon, extraneous extension or even the wrong upper/lower case can derail the whole program. I hope
	some will implement the <a class="project" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/project/noclassdeffounderror.html">NoClassDefFoundError Amanuensis</a> to make the problem easier to
	track down.</p>
	<p>Sun explains that it is thrown when Java Virtual Machine or a ClassLoader instance tries to load in
	the definition of a class \(as part of a normal method call or as part of creating a new instance using
	the new expression \) and no definition of the class could be found. The searched-for class definition
	existed when the currently executing class was compiled, but the definition can no longer be found. It is
	similar to a <span class="class">ClassNotFoundException</span>. This gives you the hint that a <span class="class">NoClassDefFoundError</span> problem was <strong>not</strong> with caused by aÂ 
	<!-- macro Qualified Class.forName class --><!-- generated --><span class="qualified"><span class="class">Class</span>.<span class="method">forName</span></span><!-- /generated by Qualified -->.</p>
	<ol><li>Essentially the problem is the place and name where you put the class file, free-standing on disk
	or inside a jar, does match the place and name it should have, based on the classpath, the package name
	and the class name. Everything is case-sensitive and sensitive to the tiniest typo. Unfortunately,
	there is currently no <a class="project" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/project/noclassdeffounderror.html">tool</a> to tell
	you where the class should be placed \(usually there are several possibilities \) or where it is now.</li>
	<li>You got the class name wrong on the <span class="exe">java.exe</span> command line. It must include
	the full package name and class separated by dots, without the <span class="ext">*.class</span> e.g.
	<div class="bat">java.exeÂ com.mindprod.converter.Convert</div><strong>not</strong> just the class:
	<div class="bat">java.exeÂ Convert</div>Newbies often get in trouble by adding a <span class="ext">*.java</span> or <span class="ext">*.class</span> suffix. In contrast, <span class="exe">javac.exe</span> demands the <span class="ext">*.java</span> extension.</li>
	<li>You get an error message like this: <span class="output">Exception in thread <span class="quoted">main</span> java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: XXX/java</span>. When attempting to compile, you
	keyed <span class="bat">java.exe XXX.java</span> instead of <span class="bat">javac.exe
	XXX.java</span>.</li>
	<li>Java can't find the class mentioned. It is missing from the jar or classpath. Java may need
	it because it occurs as a class or superclass in a serialised <span class="class">ObjectStream</span>
	or because you called a method of that class. You don't find out about the problem at compile
	time or even load time. You only find out when you actually go to use that missing class. The missing
	class was present when the class referencing it was compiled \(perhaps on somebody else's machine \)
	but the missing class is no longer accessible. To fix a vanilla <span class="class">NoClassDefFoundError</span>, search the all the jar files on your machine for the missing
	class. <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/searchreplace.html">Funduc Search and Replace</a> will do that. If you
	can't find it, scour the web for a download. When you find it, make sure its jar is on the
	general classpath, the project classpath, the command line classpath or in the <span class="dir">ext</span> directories of the various <!-- macro Acronym JREs --><!-- generated --><a class="acronymdef" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/jre.html">JREs</a> \(<span class="means"><span class="ac">J</span>ava <span class="ac">R</span>untime <span class="ac">E</span>nvironments</span> \)<!-- /generated by Acronym -->

	<li>Three diagnostic tools you may find helpful:
	<ol><li>To dump the classpath that you are actually using at some point in your code insert: You must
	first determine if the classpath is correct with:

	<li>If you have a jar or more than one class, assign each class to a package! Package-less classes
	are for one-shot, single-class throw-away experiments only.</li>
	<li>Then when you are sure the jar or directory you want is truly on the classpath \(it is not
	sufficient for the directory that the jar is in be on the classpath \), then check the contents of
	the jar with <span class="exe">jarlook</span> to make sure your package/class is in there, spelled
	precisely, including case. You can <a class="download" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/products1.html#JARLOOK">download

	<li><a class="download" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/products1.html#JARCHECK">download jarcheck</a> as well. It will
	help you detect problems with unexpected target versions of class files in your jars.</li></ol></li>
	<li>Recall that reconstitution of serialized files uses <span class="class">Class</span>. <span class="method">forName</span> to instantiate all the classes buried in the files. <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/genjar.html">Genjar</a> or equivalent does not know to include these classes in your jar. It is up to
	you to include all the classes you need manually. You will keep getting the dreaded <span class="class">NoClassDefFoundError</span> until you have nailed them all.</li>
	<li>Look for a typo in spelling the class file name in the file or in the command line invoking its
	main method. Copy/paste to make sure they are absolutely identical including case.</li>
	<li>Check your <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/classpath.html">classpath</a>. Make sure you used semicolons or
	colons as appropriate. Don't specify null fields in your classpath, e.g. two semicolons in a
	row.</li>
	<li>The problem is essentially either the class is not on the classpath or the classpath is wrong. You

	<li>If your program used to work and it <span class="quoted">suddenly</span> stopped working, did you

	<span class="ext">*.jar</span> in the extensions folder is up to date. Basically only
	thoroughly-tested, stable code should live in the extensions folder.</li>

	<li>If your <span class="class">NoClassDefFoundError</span> occurs only sporadically, here is a
	possible cause: You are running some classes in a jar file which is stored on a network mapped drive in
	MS Windows. Sun keeps the jar files open in order to re-load classes which haven't been used in a
	while and occasional network problems will force the jar to close. The <!-- macro Acronym JVM --><!-- generated --><span class="acronym"><abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr></span><!-- /generated by Acronym -->
	doesn't know to re-open the jar when the network mapped drive reconnects and simply reports that
	various classes \(different each time \) no longer exist. The solution is either make sure the network is
	reliable, use a network file system which doesn't close if drives are temporarily unavailable, or
	locate all jar files on local drives.</li>

	<li>If your code works then suddenly stops working, chances are you have uninstalled a JRE/JDK or

The InputMismatchExcpetion will usually happen when you're using a Scanner and try to use <code>nextInt()</code> or <code>nextDouble()</code>. These methods can only be used when the next thing the Scanner will see is an <code>int</code> or a <code>double</code>, respectively. If the next thing the Scanner will see contains letters or just doesn't look like a number, you will get this error. Look agian at the order of the things you are expecting. You may want to use <code>next()</code> instead.

u: USE_DOCS (0=1)
Another thing you can do to try and fix an exception is looking at the documentation for the method you're using. For example, let's consider the following code.
<div class="mlcode">
Scanner scan = new Scanner();  // line 1
scan.nextInt("s");             // line 2
</div>
I run it and get an exception. First, look at the error you got. The error information should tell you where the error happened. Look for a line number in a method that you wrote. For me, my error happened on line 2.
<ul id="choices">
<li>Go on.</li>
<li>Stop.</li>
</ul>
	#! Stop.
	a: (stop)
	You got it.
	
	#! Go on.
	a: (go on)
	Nice. Ok, now look at the line where the error happened. My line looks like this: <code>scan.nextInt("s");</code>. Now, look for the object that is calling the method. For me, <code>scan</code> is calling the <code>nextInt()</code> method.
	<ul id="choices">
	<li>Go on.</li>
	<li>Stop.</li>
	</ul>
		#! Stop.
		b: (stop)
		You got it.
		
		#! Go on.
		b: (go on)
		Cool. So, now, try to find what type of object is causing the error. For me, if I look up to line 1 (<code>Scanner scan = new Scanner();</code>), I see that <code>scan</code> is a Scanner.
		<ul id="choices">
		<li>Go on.</li>
		<li>Stop.</li>
		</ul>
			#! Stop.
			c: (stop)
			You got it.
			
			#! Go on.
			c: (go on)
			Awesome. Now, look up the documentation for the object. Usually you can do this by looking through the project description, clicking on "World" or "Actor", or by looking up "java &ltname of the object>" and clicking on a result form the Oracle Help Center.
			<ul id="choices">
			<li>Go on.</li>
			<li>Stop.</li>
			</ul>
				#! Stop.
				d: (stop)
				You got it.
				
				#! Go on.
				d: (go on)
				Great, now search the documentation for the method name. For me, I'll search for "nextInt". Once you find it, click on the method name. Then, read down to the section titled "Throws:". Here you fill find the reasons why your method will throw a certain exception. My code was throwing an InputMismatchExcpetion. Now I know that's because "the next token does not match the Integer regular expression, or is out of range".
