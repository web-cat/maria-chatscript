You must import either a <span class="package">packagename.*</span> or <span class="package">packagename</span>.
<span class="class">Classname</span>. You can’t just <span class="k">import</span> <span class="package">packagename</span> or
<span class="k">import</span> <span class="class">Classname</span>. You
don’t import classes in the same package as the current class. In other
words, the thing you import will always contain at least one <span class="charliteral">.</span>. You don’t use <span class="k">import</span>
for code not in any package. You have to put such classes on the classpath.
Whenever you have more than one class, it is a good idea to assign every class
to an explicit package with a <span class="k">package</span> statement.
In summary, you import fully qualified classes, with package and classname
separated by a dot. You don’t import classes without packages.

Some compilers may complain about the clash in SomeClass, even if you never
reference it. And, of course, all references to <span class="class">SomeClass</span> should be disambiguated to either <span class="package">x.y.</span><span class="class">SomeClass</span> or <span class="package">a.b.</span><span class="class">SomeClass</span>. Alternatively, you
can throw out all the imports and fully qualify all classes in x.y and a.b.
This approach makes code easier to maintain because it is easier to find the
code that implements the class when it is fully qualified. In your own
classes, try to use globally unique class names. Even if the computer
understands the ambiguity, humans often become confused.

u: CANNOT_FIND_SYMBOL (cannotfindsymbol) 
You used a variable name you did not define. Perhaps you forgot the
declaration. Perhaps you declared it inside a block/loop and you tried to use
it outside the block/loop. You must move the declaration to an encompassing
outer block that encloses all the references. Perhaps you spelled the
variable slightly differently in declaration and reference. Watch your caps
and double letters carefully. Perhaps you left out or mistyped the
corresponding <span class="k">import</span> or <span class="k">static import</span>.
<p><span class="quoted">Cannot find symbol constructor <var>XXX</var></span>,
means you likely you did an explicit <var>XXX</var> \(\) to call the superclass

<p><span class="quoted">Cannot find symbol method <var>XXX</var></span>,
where <var>XXX</var> is your class’s superclass constructor means you

constructor first thing in your constructor instead of using <span class="k">super \(\)</span>.</p>
<p>Possible causes of the error for constructors and methods:</p>
<ul><li>Wrong syntax for calling: constructor: <span class="k">new</span>
<span class="class">X</span> \(\), instance: <span class="var">x</span>.
<span class="method">someMethod</span> \(\), static:
<!-- macro Qualified SomeClass.someMethod class --><!-- generated --><span class="qualified"><span class="class">SomeClass</span>.<span class="method">someMethod</span></span><!-- /generated by Qualified -->
 \(\).</li>
<li>The method you want is <span class="k">protected</span> or
<span class="k">private</span>.</li>
<li>You left out a parm.</li>
<li>You added an extra parm.</li>
<li>You have the parms in the wrong order.</li>
<li>You have the type of a parm wrong, e.g. it wants a <span class="class">File</span>, but you gave it a String.</li>
<li>Symbols are case-sensitive. You have a mismatch.</li>
<li>Confused package. <span class="exe">Javac.exe</span> is looking in the
wrong package or class, e.g. <span class="package">java.util</span>.<span class="interface">List</span> vs
<!-- macro Qualified java.awt.List class --><!-- generated --><span class="qualified"><span class="package">java</span>.<span class="package">awt</span>.<span class="class">List</span></span><!-- /generated by Qualified --><!-- macro Qualified \{awt.List \} --><!-- generated --><span class="qualified"><span class="package">awt</span>.<span class="class">List</span></span><!-- /generated by Qualified -->. Use fully qualified references to rule
that out.</li>
<li>The referenced class did not compile because it has a syntax
error.</li>
<li>The needed class/jar files are not on the classpath.</li>
<li>Cannot find symbol method <span class="method">sort</span> \(<span class="package">java.util</span>.<span class="class">ArrayList</span>&lt;Xxx&gt; \)
could mean you have not implemented <span class="interface">Comparator</span> on the class you are trying to sort.</li>
<li>There is some other syntax error, than the compiler interprets its
strange way as an undefined symbol.</li></ul>Using the <span class="bat">-verbose</span> option on <span class="exe">javac.exe</span> will give you hints to help resolve this error.

u: CANT_OVERRIDE_2 (cantoveride2) 
Overridden methods cannot add any throws clauses not in the
base method they are overriding.

u: (can not override)
^reuse(CANT_OVERRIDE_2)

u: CANT_OVERRIDE_3 (cantoveride3) 
When you override an existing method, you must use exactly the
same method signature including return type. Perhaps you did not realise you
were overriding a method. In <!-- macro Java 1.5+ --><!-- generated -->Java version <span class="version">1.5</span> or later<!-- /generated by Java -->,
you may return a subclass of the base return type.

u: (can not override)
^reuse(CANT_OVERRIDE_3)

u: CANNOT_RESOLVE_CONSTRUCTOR (cannotresolveconstructor) 
If a subclasses constructor does not call one of the constructors of the
superclass as the very first thing, java inserts a call to the default
constructor for you <span class="java">super \(\)</span>. If you have not
defined that null constructor, you will get an error. The usual way to fix it
is by inserting some sort of <span class="java">super \( parm \);</span> as the
first statement of your subclass constructor.

u: (can not resolve constructor)
^reuse(CANNOT_RESOLVE_CONSTRUCTOR)

u: CANNOT_RESOLVE_SYMBOL (cannotresolvesymbol) 
\<ul><li>No such variable or method. Perhaps it exists, but not in the current
<a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/scope.html">scope</a>, e.g. you are trying to use a
variable defined inside a loop outside that loop.</li>
<li>Possibly you are trying to use a constructor without <span class="k">new</span> as if it were an ordinary method.</li>
<li>You left off the \(\) on your method call.</li>
<li>If the error message is pointing to code that uses the standard
classes, chances are you either misspelled it, or forgot to import the
class, or misspelled the import. If it is pointing to one of your methods
or variables chances are you misspelled it either in the definition or
reference. Java is picky. You must get upper-lower case precisely correct
too.</li>
<li>If the code is pointing to one of your classes that is clearly there,
perhaps you forgot to put C&colon;\ on the classpath — the mother of all
packages where com is in <span class="package">com.mindprod.thispackage</span> lives. If you are not using
packages, perhaps you forgot to put. on your classpath. A symptom of this
is you can compile successfully if you rebuild everything, but not if you
just recompile the changed modules.</li>
<li>You are using a method of the object when the reference is to an
interface that does not contain that method. Either cast to specific
object, or change the reference to a specific object reference, e. g.
<!-- macro JDisplay errormessages.example2.javafrag --><!-- generated --><iframe class="jdisplay" height="375" src="snippet/iframe/errormessages.example2.javafrag.htm" width="563"></iframe><!-- /generated by JDisplay -->
<span class="method">addNever</span> is a method of <span class="class">MultiFilter</span>, but not of <span class="interface">FileNameFilter</span>.</li>
<li>Watch for subtle spelling differences between declaration and
reference, e.g. <span class="class">Hashtable</span> and <span class="class">HashTable</span>. Copy/paste the definition on top of the reference
to be sure they are absolutely identical. Your eyes can fool you.</li>
<li>In an <span class="k">implements</span> clause, you may have used
a period where you should have used a comma.</li>
<li>If is complaining about the superclass of your constructor, the problem
is you must either explicitly call <span class="k">super \(\)</span>, or
there must be a superclass constructor with a matching signature.</li></ul>

u: ([class interface enum] declaration expected)

u: CLASS_EXPECTED (classexpected) 
There is a missing <span class="op"> \{</span> somewhere
much earlier in the code. <span class="k">class</span> and <span class="k">interface</span> must be all lower case. Another way of looking at
it, you method and variable definitions come after <span class="k">class</span>, not <span class="k">package</span>.

You must specify the precise name of the enclosing class, e.g. <span class="class">MyApplet</span>. <span class="method">this</span> not one of its

You misspelled the package name on the package statement. It
must match the name of the directory containing the Java source.

u: DUP_METHODS (duplicatemethods) 
You have two methods with the same name and the same signature
i.e. number and types of parameters. You can’t have two methods that
differ only in return type.

u: ENUM_AS_IDENTIFIER (enumasidentifier) 
Starting with <!-- macro Java 1.5 --><!-- generated -->Java version <span class="version">1.5</span><!-- /generated by Java -->,
<span class="k">enum</span> became a reserved keyword. Older programs
may have used the word <span class="k">enum</span> as a variable, method
or package name. You will have to globally rename <span class="k">enum</span> to some other identifier, or convert the code to use the
new built-in <span class="k">enum</span> features.

u: (enum as identifier)
^reuse(ENUM_AS_IDENTIFIER)

u: WRITING (writing) 
You used the <span class="exe">javac.exe</span> <span class="parm">-d</span> option. The compiler is trying to write the generated class
files to this directory, but it cannot, probably because it does not exist. The
compiler wants to create a tree of package names in that directory. You may
have it blocked by files of the same name as the packages. Use lower case for
all package names and directories.

u: (error while writing)
^reuse(WRITING)

u: EXCEPTION_NEVER_THROWN (exceptionneverthrown) 
You are trying to catch an exception that could never happen.
Just remove the try/catch. Java does not like you trying to catch an exception
that could never happen, but oddly it does not mind you declaring a throws that
could never happen.

u: (exception never thrown)
^reuse(EXCEPTION_NEVER_THROWN)

u: FINAL_PARAM (finalparameter) 
The wording is ambiguous. You might think it means the
parameter might, under some circumstances, escape being assigned. That is not
what it means.

u: (final parameter xxx may not be assigned) 
^reuse(FINAL_PARAM)

u: GENERIC_ARRAY (genericarray) 
\<p>You might have written <span class="k">new</span> <span class="class">ArrayList</span> &lt;<span class="class">String</span>&gt; \[ 100 \] instead of <span class="k">new</span>
<span class="class">ArrayList</span>&lt; <span class="class">String</span>&gt; \( <span class="numeric">100</span> \);</p>
<p>To be charitable, Java’s generics are Mickey Mouse. One of the side
effects of the el-cheapo implementation is that you can’t have arrays
of generic collections, e. g. the following is illegal</p>

u: (generic array creation) 
^reuse(GENERIC_ARRAY)

u: IDENTIFIER_EXPECTED (identifierexpected) 
Look for a missing \{ slightly before of where it is complaining. It may also
be a <a class="jgloss" target="_blank" href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/balancing.html"> \} before the code</a> that
should appear after. It can also be caused by attempting to define a
constructor in an <span class="k">interface</span>. Perhaps you wrote
some initialisation code without enclosing it in <span class="k">static</span> <span class="op"> \{\}</span> or plain
<span class="op"> \{\}</span>. Method calls must be inside methods or init
blocks, not just lying loose in amongst the field declarations.

u: (identifier expected)
^reuse(IDENTIFIER_EXPECTED)

u: ILLEGAL_CHAR (illegalcharacter) 
You used Unicode 8220 \(aka \u291c, 0x291c, “, left quote \)
or 8821 \(aka \u291d, 0x291d, ”, right quote \) instead of a simple 34 \(aka
\u0022, 0x22, \" \) that Java requires. This probably resulted from using a
word processor like MS Word instead of a text processor or
<!-- macro Acronym IDE --><!-- generated --><span class="acronym"><abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr></span><!-- /generated by Acronym -->
to compose your Java source which converts "s into <span class="quoted">and</span> .

u: (illegal character)
^reuse(ILLEGAL_CHAR)

u: ILLEGAL_ESCAPE (illegalescape) 
Mostly likely you forget to double each <span class="string">\</span> in a
filename <span class="class">String</span>, e. g. you should write
<span class="string"><span class="quoted">C:\\temp\\somefile.txt</span></span> not <span class="string"><span class="quoted">C:\temp\somefile.txt</span></span>. Backslash
<span class="string">\</span> has special meaning inside <span class="class">String</span>s, e. g. <span class="string">\n</span> means newline,
<span class="string">\t</span> means tab, <span class="string">\"</span>
means embedded ". <span class="string">\\</span> means a single
<span class="string">\</span>. If you used <span class="string">\</span>
followed by a letter without special meaning, you will get this error
message.

u: (illegal escape)
^reuse(ILLEGAL_ESCAPE)

u: ILLEGAL_FORWARD (illegalforward) 
\<p>Java computes its <span class="k">static</span> initialisation in a
simplistic top to bottom way. It is not clever, in using natural order like a
spreadsheet. Any value you reference must be defined lexically earlier in the
class. This holds both for the order of initialisations and for the order of
assignments in a <span class="k">static</span> init or instance init
block.</p>
<ul><li>You may not reference an <span class="k">enum</span> constant
that has not yet been defined. e.g. you cannot reference other <span class="k">enum</span> constants in an <span class="k">enum</span>
constructor call.</li>
<li>You must declare <span class="k">static final</span>s before you
define them in a <span class="k">static</span> init block. Put your
<span class="k">static</span> init blocks after all your <span class="k">static final</span> variables.</li>
<li>You must define the value of a <span class="k">static
final</span> before you can use it in defining the value of another
<span class="k">static final</span>.</li></ul>

u: (illegal forward reference)

u: ILLEGAL_STATIC_REF (illegalstaticref) 
\<div class="gotcha"><span class="k">enum</span> constructors cannot access the
<span class="k">enum</span> <span class="k">static</span>
fields. However, they can invoke the <span class="k">enum</span>’s <span class="k">static</span> methods
that access the <span class="k">static</span> fields, but they
won’t get the right values. The easiest way out is to convert your
<span class="k">static</span> constants to instance constants.
Strange as it seems, they <strong>are</strong> initialised before the
constructor code. Constructors may, however, directly access <span class="k">static final</span> in-lineable constants known at compile time.</div>The problem is <span class="k">static</span> initialisation has
not been done at the time the <span class="k">enum</span> constructor
constant constructors are invoked, so <span class="k">static</span>
methods called from your constructors will just see zeros/nulls. Why this
screwy rule? You’d think <span class="k">static</span>s would be
initialised first, the way they are with any other classes. The
