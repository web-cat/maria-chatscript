# =============================================================================
# This topic contains technical rules that allow the Web-CAT client to send
#  information to the ChatScript server. This includes sending student 
#  information, sending signals when various events occurring (student opens
#  the chat window), and getting the starting response. One benefit to
#  sending this information to the server is that it will appear in the logs
#  and it can be stored in ChatScript variables.
